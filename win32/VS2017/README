libvorbis has libogg as a dependency, you need to have libogg compiled
beforehand, in either static or dynamic configuration as desired.

The libvorbis projects use a Visual Studio property page file (libogg.props)
that specifies where to locate the headers and libraries.  The expectation is
that source trees of libogg and libvorbis are siblings.  libogg typically has a
version number in it's name (e.g. 'libogg-1.3.2').  The property page is set up
to define this version number, and to search for includes and libs relative to
that named directory.  As a convenience, it also will search an unadorned
libogg directory (i.e. 'libogg') for those items.

If you use a different version of libogg, you can either:

1. Open libogg.props with a text editor (even notepad.exe
will suffice) and set the PropertyGroup labelled "UserMacros" to the version
you are using (e.g. "x.y.z"). or

2. Rename libogg-x.y.z to libogg.

Also note, the properties page refers to directories created in libogg that
include the version of Visual Studio (in this case VS2017 for the
AdditionalLibraryDirectories).  If you import this solution into a later
version of Visual Studio, you will probably need to update those references
(and rebuild libogg with that version, as well).
